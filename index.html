    <div id='div1' class="flex-container">
        <div id="child">
            <img src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png" alt="Bubble and pie chart">

            <p id="pad">The data types for the above bubble and pie chart is a quantitative attribute. 
                There is quantitative continuous data on either axis. The data encompassed in the pie charts is 
                categorical, distributed into 3 categories. The size of the angles in the data are out of 100 for 
                the angles. The marks for the above chart are the containment areas between subcategories that indicate
                the amount of the third value for the bubbles and these bubbles are also used as points. There are many
                different channels. The position is used for x and y axes for the attribute items, the tilt creates and represents 
                the angle and size of the bubble charts, the size for the area of the bubbles for the 3 categories as mentioned above
                and the color for the different categories in the separate pie charts in the chart shown above.</p>

        <div id="child">
            <img src="img/bump_chart.png" 
            width="450" height="350" alt="Bump Chart">

            <p id="pad">The data types in the above chart are attributes, specifically ordinal.
                The marks are the points for each data point in each listed year as well the lines 
                connecting them. The marks are used as nodes (each point) and the lines are used as 
                links. The channels are the different colors of each line and position on the axis, 
                both vertical and horizontal. Tilt could also be considered a channel. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="child">
            <img src="img/mind_map.png" 
            width="450" height="350"alt="Mind Map">

            <p id="pad">The data types seen in the above chart are items (each node in the map) 
                and links (the relationships between the nodes). The marks are the nodes in the 
                map (like points) and the lines between them. The node marks are used as items and 
                the lines connecting them are links. The channels are the different colors and potentially
                the position of the nodes from the lines that lead to them.</p>

        <div id="child">
            <img src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" 
            width="450" height="350" alt="Stacked Bar Chart">

            <p id="pad">The data types in the above chart are attributes, where the values on 
                the y axis are quantitative and the values on the x axis are categorical. 
                The marks can be considered either the area of each bar and its smaller segments or 
                consider each bar as a line. The marks are used as links as containment. The channels 
                are the different colors to differentiate between the segments, the size of the whole bar 
                and its segments (can be from area or length depending on what marks is considered).</p>
